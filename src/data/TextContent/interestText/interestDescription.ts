export const cheffingDescription = `My culinary journey began unexpectedly in Bangkok. 
After losing my wallet, I found myself helping at a local cooking school - washing dishes 
in exchange for lessons. Through passionate chefs teaching me techniques - like building up 
a curry paste from scratch - I discovered a deep appreciation for the craft of 
cooking and the experience of making

During an 'Anthropology of Food' module in my studies, I discovered how meals transcend mere
sustenance and momentary pleasure - they're a universal language for sharing culture and building connections. This theoretical understanding deepened my passion 
for cooking, which I later got to apply while supporting food-based recovery programs at 
Freedom from Torture. 

Today, exploring new restaurants and cuisines inspires my own cooking adventures, 
where I love bringing friends together over homemade meals.`;

There's something captivating about facing a daunting route - analysing, attempting, slipping, 
reassessing, and finally finding that strategy to defy gravity.

This passion for vertical challenges naturally evolved into hiking adventures across the globe. 
From trudging through Amazonian mud with deteriorating boots to camping in the freezing temperatures 
of Patagonia. Each journey has reinforced that with adaptability and determination, seemingly insurmountable
challenges become achievable goals.

Today, you'll often find me planning the next trek, always eager to discover 
what lies around the next bend or over the next ridge.`;

export const creativeDescription = `My journey in the art world began through hands-on experience - 
working with artists on the Emscher Art Trail and later at the Venice Biennale. These 
experiences showed me how artists collaborate and challenge perspectives to communicate 
complex ideas through innovative work.

Being immersed in these creative environments taught me the value of lateral 
thinking and finding unconventional solutions. From helping to install large-scale 
installations to coordinating with artists across language barriers, each project 
revealed new ways of approaching and solving challenges.

Today, I explore creative outlets both as an observer and through my film photography hobby - 
finding joy in visiting galleries and capturing moments on 35mm that tell their own quiet stories.`;
