const project1Para1 = `Built as my first SEB project, DotMan is a grid-based browser game and homage 
to PacMan, featuring a retro visual design inspired by childhood summers spent in British seaside arcade halls.`;

const project1Para2 = `The game implements sophisticated ghost AI through pathfinding algorithms. The primary chase ghost uses Breadth-First 
Search (BFS) to find optimal routes to the player, while the ambusher ghost employs a dual-mode system - calculating 
interception points before switching to direct pursuit when close.`;

const project1Para3 = `Alongside classic PacMan elements like pellets and power-ups, I added a unique twist with a third ghost that randomly 
teleports across the maze in a whack-a-mole style, forcing players to constantly scan the playing field.`;

const project2Para1 = `Developed during a 48-hour hackathon with one week of React experience, this Harry Potter 
themed quiz app was built using driver-navigator pair programming to consume a public API.`;

const project2Para2 = `The game features two modes: 'Classic' for matching characters to names, and 'Hard' for identifying actors. We implemented 
recursive functions for character selection and the Fisher-Yates algorithm for answer randomization, handling API 
inconsistencies with valid image verification.`;

const project2Para3 = `The application showcases modular design with reusable components, featuring timed responses, score tracking, and a 
persistent top 5 leaderboard. This project demonstrates how effective pair programming can deliver polished results under 
tight constraints.`;

const project3Para1 = `Built using the MERN stack with TypeScript, Kino Connect was inspired by London's 
independent cinema scene and aims to preserve these vital cultural spaces in an era dominated by multiplex chains.`;

const project3Para2 = `The platform centers around dynamic notice boards for event management, implementing role-based access control through 
JWT authentication. 'Cinema' accounts manage venue profiles while 'Film Fanatic' accounts engage with events and comments, 
all structured within MongoDB's flexible schema.`;

const project3Para3 = `The frontend integrates Mapbox for location services and Cloudinary for image management, emphasizing TypeScript's
type safety throughout. The architecture prioritizes component reusability and efficient state management, creating
a scalable platform that serves this unique community.`;

const project4Para1 = `OpenStudio is a full-stack marketplace built with Python/Django and TypeScript/React, 
aimed at empowering artists by eliminating traditional gallery commission rates. The platform connects artists directly 
with collectors, inspired by personal experiences in the fine art world.`;

const project4Para2 = `The application distinguishes between artist and collector accounts through JWT authentication, with artists managing 
portfolios and order requests while collectors curate personal galleries. The Django/PostgreSQL backend ensures 
transaction integrity, while the frontend handles UK-specific shipping calculations and insurance requirements.`;

const project4Para3 = `The platform replaces traditional cart systems with an order request mechanic, developed through artist feedback to 
accommodate exhibition schedules. This approach, combined with real-time notifications and multi-step purchase flows, 
demonstrates how user input shaped technical solutions.`;
